# ICPC Utils

This repository contains Eliot Hall's practice for the ICPC. It consists of implementations
of common data structures and algorithms in C++ headers.
It is designed to be a header-only library so that the reference implementations are self-contained.

Structures can be found in the structures directory. Demos can be found in the demos directory.
Algorithms can be found in the algs directory.

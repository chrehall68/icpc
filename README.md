# ICPC Utils

This repository contains Eliot Hall's ICPC structures, as well as demos of each.
It is designed to be a header-only library so that headers can be quickly and easily
copy-pasted into client C++ programs that can be compiled and run without DLL dependencies (ie on
the competition server)

Structures can be found in the structures directory. Demos can be found in the demos directory.
